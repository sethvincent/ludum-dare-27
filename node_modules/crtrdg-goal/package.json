  "readme": "# crtrdg-goal\n> achievements module for games\n\n## Goals for crtrdg-goal:\n- Quick and dirty little achievements system for crtrdg games.\n\n\n## Requirements\n- node.js\n- browserify / beefy\n- crtrdg-gameloop (or possibly another method of animating the canvas with requestAnimationFrame that emits `update` and `draw` events)\n\n## Getting started\nInstall node if you haven't already.\n\n### Install browserify and beefy:\n```\nnpm install -g browserify beefy\n```\n\n## Usage:\n### Create an index.html file:\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>crtrdg goal test</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<canvas id=\"game\"></canvas>\n\n<script src=\"./bundle.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Create a game.js file:\n```\n\n```\n\n## Purpose of `crtrdg`:\nAlmost every javascript game / animation library I've found bundles things like requestAnimationFrame polyfill, gameloop, entities, abstract drawing methods, keyboard/mouse input, vector math, and more into one entangled library. If I don't like how the library handles just one of those components, I'm stuck with dead library weight, and sometimes it's difficult to replace a library's methods.\n\nSo what if each element of 2d games were broken up into it's own modules / repositories?\n\nWith inspiration from voxel.js, crtrdg is a collection of javascript modules used for developing 2d games.\n\nAs I learned more about node.js, the core events module, and browserify, I realized the ideal api for making simple 2d games could be based on node's events module. So you'll see a lot of crtrdg modules exposing an api that includes `.on('some event', function(){})`, which seems to make a lot of sense for games.\n\n## Other `crtrdg` modules:\n- [crtrdg-gameloop](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-gameloop)\n- [crtrdg-entity](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-entity)\n- [crtrdg-keyboard](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-keyboard)\n- [crtrdg-mouse](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-mouse)\n- [crtrdg-scene](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-mouse)\n\n## Contributing\n- Fork this repository.\n- Create a branch for you changes.\n- Include tests if applicable.\n- Add/edit documentation for any changes.\n- Submit a pull request.\n\n## License\nMIT",
